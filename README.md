# Reinforcement_Learning_Final_Project

* Project Description: 
This is a project for COMS 6998 (Practical Deep Learning Systems Performance). 
The goal of this project is to explore various Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms and strategies 
for the Cartpole problem and to compare and contrast their performances to see what is ideal.
All models were run on Windows 10 with a Titan RTX GPU.

* Repository:
The files include various deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DQN, A2C, PPO) implemented in OpenAI Gym,
Stable-Baseline3 and integrated with Weights and Bias tracking API. 

* Example code:
$ python DQN.py 

* Results:
